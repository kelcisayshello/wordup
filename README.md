# WordUp
Thanks for using *WordUp*, a minimalistic word counter built using TypeScript, React, and [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons âœ¨.

### Background
[WordUp](https://www.kelcimensah.dev/wordup) is a no-bloat online tool that counts the number of words and characters in typed or pasted text. WordUp was built with simplicity in mind and does not use any external plug-ins, add-ons, or text checkers, so you can be assured your text isn't being stored anywhere.

### Reporting an issue?
Email me any time at `kelcimensah@gmail.com` with the subject line `[WordUp] {YOUR ISSUE HERE}` (without the `{` and `}` characters).

### Background
[WordUp](https://www.kelcimensah.dev/wordup) is a no-bloat online tool that live counts the number of words and characters in typed (or pasted) text by using the React `useState` hook. WordUp was built with simplicity in mind and does not use any external plug-ins, add-ons, or text checkers â€” nor plans to. This is so you can rest assured your text isn't being stored or used anywhere else.
